# FitFi: Social. Fitness. Finance. (PoC)

## Description
FitFi is a mobile-first SocialFi dApp that gamifies physical activity through DeFi mechanics. Users stake assets in no-loss pools generating yield through DeFi protocols. Smart contracts distribute rewards based on verified movement data from mobile sensors and group participation metrics.

## Motivation
Traditional fitness apps lack sustainable engagement mechanisms. FitFi solves this through:
- Financial incentives without capital risk (no-loss model)
- Social accountability via group dynamics
- Transparent reward distribution through smart contracts
- Sustainable reward generation via DeFi yields

## Wow Factor
- No-Loss Pool: All deposited funds are safe, *only the DeFi yield* is used as rewards, capital is always safe.
- Group multipliers: Activity rewards are amplified when performed in groups, incetivizing accountability and community building.
- Privacy-preserving activity verification: No personal data is stored on-chain, only the activity data is verified.
