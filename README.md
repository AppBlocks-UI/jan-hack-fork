# FitFi: Social. Fitness. Finance. (PoC)

## Description
FitFi is a mobile-first SocialFi dApp that gamifies physical activity through DeFi mechanics. Users stake assets in no-loss pools generating yield through DeFi protocols. Smart contracts distribute rewards based on verified movement data from mobile sensors and group participation metrics.

## Motivation
Traditional fitness apps lack sustainable engagement mechanisms. FitFi solves this through:
- Financial incentives without capital risk (no-loss model)
- Social accountability via group dynamics
- Transparent reward distribution through smart contracts
- Sustainable reward generation via DeFi yields

## Wow Factor
- Novel integration of mobile sensor data with on-chain verification
- Group multiplier system: rewards increase by 1.5x when exercising with others
- Leaderboards for fun competition
- Privacy-preserved activity verification
